# Ray Tracing in Stochastic Droplet Media

Currently under development, this package aims to model laser interaction within a media of randomly distributed liquid droplets through means of ray tracing.

Requires:
[Eigen](github.com/PX4/eigen) for numerical linear algebra.
[catch2](github.com/catchorg/Catch2) for testing purposes.
